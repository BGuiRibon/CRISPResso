
[1.0.8]
> Fixed the cup!
> Fixed  allels around cut site plot with seaborn >= 0.8.0

[1.0.7]
> Alleles around cut sites fixed if multiple cuts are present 

[1.0.6]
> Fixed plots when more than 2 sgRNA sequences are provided
> Introduced new summary table for alleles around each cut site 
> Introduced a new graphical report for allele around each cut site (Figures files starting with 9.)

[1.0.5]
> Fixed small error in saving offset for cut sites in plots

[1.0.4]
> Fixed quantification of insertion in reads that align in the reverse complement of the amplicon
> Fixed window not symmetric for w=1
> Fixed cut point visualization if the guide is in the reverse amplicon 


[1.0.3]
> Introduced a new utility: CRISPRessoCount to count guides representation given a fastq or fastq.gz file

[1.0.2]
> Fixed function that removed characters not allowed  forcing the name to become lowercase and causing problem with CRISPRessoPooled

[1.0.1]
> Fixed -s parameter being ignored if -q was not specified
> Remove characters not allowed in the name if specified with the --name option (they are all replaced with '_')
> New option --split_paired_end to support paired end reads encoded in a single file (for example data obtained trough the MGH core in Boston: )

[1.0.0] First stable release!
> Introduced a new report in output: allelic frequency table (Alleles_frequency_table.txt). Table with a summary of all the alleles detected, % of reads supporting them and 
classification (unmodified, NHEJ, HDR and mixed). You can open this file with Excel.
